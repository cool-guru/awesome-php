# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Please search previous issues before making a suggestion, as it may be a duplicate.

2. Libraries that are Composer installable, PSR compliant, and tested are preferred.

3. Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

4. Please use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.

5. Please prefix duplicate library names with their vendor or namespace followed by a space: Orno\DI would be Orno DI.

6. Please keep descriptions short and simple. 

7. Please end all descriptions with a full stop/period.

I try to open a suggestions issue each month, so feel free to add anything interesting to it. Iâ€™m also open to creating new categories or improving the existing ones.

Thank you for your suggestions!
