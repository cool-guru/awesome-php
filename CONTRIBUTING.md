* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Please use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Please prefix duplicate library names with their vendor or namespace followed by a space: Orno\DI would be Orno DI.

I try to open a suggestions issue each month, so feel free to add anything interesting to it. Iâ€™m also open to creating new categories or improving the existing ones.

Thank you for your suggestions!
